# Hajimari Frontend

Hajimari's web UI is implemented as an SPA (single page app) utilizing the [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) static adapter.

## Developing

Once you've checked out the project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
